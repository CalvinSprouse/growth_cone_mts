  abstract = {Mechanical force plays a fundamental role in neuronal development, physiology, and regeneration. In particular, research has shown that force is involved in growth cone-mediated axonal growth and guidance as well as stretch-induced elongation when an organism increases in size after forming initial synaptic connections. However, much of the details about the exact role of force in these fundamental processes remain unknown. In this review, we highlight: (1) standing questions concerning the role of mechanical force in axonal growth and guidance; and (2) different experimental techniques used to quantify forces in axons and growth cones. We believe that satisfying answers to these questions will require quantitative information about the relationship between elongation, forces, cytoskeletal dynamics, axonal transport, signaling, substrate adhesion, and stiffness contributing to directional growth advance. Furthermore, we address why a wide range of force values have been reported in the literature, and what these values mean in the context of neuronal mechanics. We hope that this review will provide a guide for those interested in studying the role of force in development and regeneration of neuronal networks.},

  abstract = {A growth cone is a motile structure at the tips of axons that is driven by the actin network and guides axon extension. Low actin adhesion to the substrate creates a stationary actin treadmill that allows leading-edge protrusion when adhesion increases in response to guidance cues. We use experimental measurements in the Aplysia bag growth cone to develop and constrain a simple mechanical model of the actin treadmill. We show that actin retrograde flow is primarily generated by myosin contractile forces, but when myosin is inhibited, leading-edge membrane tension increases and drives the flow. By comparing predictions of the model with previous experimental measurements, we demonstrate that lamellipodial and filopodial filament breaking contribute equally to the resistance to the flow. The fully constrained model clarifies the role of actin turnover in the mechanical balance driving the actin treadmill and reproduces the recent experimental observation that inhibition of actin depolymerization causes retrograde flow to slow exponentially with time. We estimate forces in the actin treadmill, and we demonstrate that measured G-actin distributions are consistent with the existence of a forward-directed fluid flow that transports G-actin to the leading edge. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

We analyze experimentally measured spatial distributions of actin flow, traction force, myosin density, and adhesion density in control and pharmacologically perturbed epithelial cells in order to develop a mechanical model of the actin-adhesion-myosin self-organization at the leading edge. A model in which the F-actin network is treated as a viscous gel, and adhesion clutch engagement is strengthened by myosin but weakened by actin flow, can explain the measured molecular distributions and correctly predict the spatial distributions of the actin flow and traction stress. We test the model by comparing its predictions with measurements of the actin flow and traction stress in cells with fast and slow actin polymerization rates. The model predicts how the location of the lamellipodium-lamellum boundary depends on the actin viscosity and adhesion strength. The model further predicts that the location of the lamellipodium-lamellum boundary is not very sensitive to the level of myosin contraction.},

  abstract = {In the developing nervous system, axons are guided to their synaptic targets by motile structures at the axon tip called growth cones, which reorganize their cytoskeleton in order to steer in response to chemotactic cues. Growth cone motility is mediated by an actin-adhesion ``clutch'' mechanism, in which mechanical attachment to a substrate, coupled with polarized actin growth, produces leading-edge protrusion. Several studies suggest that dynamic microtubules (MTs) in the growth cone periphery play an essential role in growth cone steering. It is not yet well-understood how the MT cytoskeleton and the dynamic actin-adhesion clutch system are coordinated to promote growth cone navigation. I introduce an experimentally motivated stochastic model of the dynamic reorganization of the growth cone cytoskeleton in response to external guidance cues. According to this model, asymmetric decoupling of MTs from actin retrograde flow leads to a local influx of MTs to the growth cone leading edge, and the leading-edge MT accumulation is amplified by positive feedback between MTs and the actin-adhesion clutch system. Local accumulation of MTs at the leading edge is hypothesized to increase actin adhesion to the substrate, which attenuates actin retrograde flow and promotes leading-edge protrusion. Growth cone alignment with the chemotactic gradient is predicted to be most effective for intermediate levels of sensitivity of the adhesion strength to the presence of leading-edge MTs. Quantitative predictions of the MT distribution and the local rate of retrograde actin flow will allow the hypothetical positive feedback mechanism to be experimentally tested.},

  abstract = {Excessive physical impacts to the head have direct implications on the structural integrity at the axonal level. Increasing evidence suggests that tau, an intrinsically disordered protein that stabilizes axonal microtubules, plays a critical role in the physical biology of axonal injury. However, the precise mechanisms of axonal damage remain incompletely understood. Here we propose a biophysical model of the axon to correlate the dynamic behavior of individual tau proteins under external physical forces to the evolution of axonal damage. To propagate damage across the scales, we adopt a consistent three-step strategy: First, we characterize the axonal response to external stretches and stretch rates for varying tau crosslink bond strengths using a discrete axonal damage model. Then, for each combination of stretch rates and bond strengths, we average the axonal force-stretch response of n =10 discrete simulations, fromwhich we derive and calibrate a homogenized constitutive model. Finally, we embed this homogenized model into a continuum axonal damage model of [1-d]-type in which d is a scalar damage parameter that is driven by the axonal stretch and stretch rate. We demonstrate that axonal damage emerges naturally from the interplay of physical forces and biological crosslinking. Our study reveals an emergent feature of the crosslink dynamics: With increasing loading rate, the axonal failure stretch increases, but axonal damage evolves earlier in time. For a wide range of physical stretch rates, from 0.1 to 10/s, and biological bond strengths, from 1 to 100pN, our model predicts a relatively narrow window of critical damage stretch thresholds, from 1.01 to 1.30, which agrees well with experimental observations. Our biophysical damage model can help explain the development and progression of axonal damage across the scales and will provide useful guidelines to identify critical damage level thresholds in response to excessive physical forces.},

  abstract = {Stretch-growth has been defined as a process that extends axons via the application of mechanical forces. In the present article, we used a protocol based on magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) for labeling the entire axon tract of hippocampal neurons, and an external magnetic field gradient to generate a dragging force. We found that the application of forces below 10 pN induces growth at a rate of 0.66 {$\pm$} 0.02 {\textmu}m h-1 pN-1. Calcium imaging confirmed the strong increase in elongation rate, in comparison with the condition of tip-growth. Enhanced growth in stretched axons was also accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accumulation and, accordingly, it was blocked by an inhibition of translation. Stretch-growth was also found to stimulate axonal branching, glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and neuronal excitability. Moreover, stretched axons showed increased microtubule (MT) density and MT assembly was key to sustaining stretch-growth, suggesting a possible role of tensile forces in MT translocation/assembly. Additionally, our data showed that stretched axons do not respond to BDNF signaling, suggesting interference between the two pathways. As these extremely low mechanical forces are physiologically relevant, stretch-growth could be an important endogenous mechanism of axon growth, with a potential for designing novel strategies for axonal regrowth. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Axon growth involves motion, and motion is driven by forces. The growth cone (GC) itself can generate very low intracellular forces by inducing a drastic cytoskeleton remodeling, in response to signaling molecules. Here, we investigated the key role of intracellular force as an endogenous regulator of axon outgrowth, which it has been neglected for decades because of the lack of methodologies to investigate the topic. Our results indicate a critical role of force in promoting axon growth by facilitating microtubule (MT) polymerization.},

  abstract = {The growth cone must push its substrate rearward via some traction force in order to propel itself forward. To determine which growth cone behaviors produce traction force, we observed chick sensory growth cones under conditions in which force production was accommodated by movement of obstacles in the environment, namely, neurites of other sensory neurons or glass fibers. The movements of these obstacles occurred via three, different, stereotyped growth cone behaviors: (a) filopodial contractions, (b) smooth rearward movement on the dorsal surface of the growth cone, and (c) interactions with ruffling lamellipodia. More than 70\% of the obstacle movements were caused by filopodial contractions in which the obstacle attached at the extreme distal end of a filopodium and moved only as the filopodium changed its extension. Filopodial contractions were characterized by frequent changes of obstacle velocity and direction. Contraction of a single filopodium is estimated to exert 50-90 {$\mu$}dyn of force, which can account for the pull exerted by chick sensory growth cones. Importantly, all five cases of growth cones growing over the top of obstacle neuntes (i.e., geometry that mimics the usual growth cone/substrate interaction), were of the filopodial contraction type. Some 25\% of obstacle movements occurred by a smooth backward movement along the top surface of growth cones. Both the appearance and rate of movements were similar to that reported for retrograde flow of cortical actin near the dorsal growth cone surface. Although these retrograde flow movements also exerted enough force to account for growth cone pulling, we did not observe such movements on ventral growth cone surfaces. Occasionally obstacles were moved by interaction with ruffling lamellipodia. However, we obtained no evidence for attachment of the obstacles to ruffling lamellipodia or for directed obstacle movements by this mechanism. These data suggest that chick sensory growth cones move forward by contractile activity of filopodia, i.e., isometric contraction on a rigid substrate. Our data argue against retrograde flow of actin producing traction force.},

To better understand this process, we examined the movement of axonal branch points, beads bound to the axon, and docked mitochondria while monitoring axonal width. We found these markers moved in a pattern that suggests elongation occurs by viscoelastic stretching and volume addition along the axon. To test the coupling between "lengthening" and "growth," we measured axonal width while forcing axons to grow and then pause by controlling the tension applied to the growth cone or to the cell body. We found axons thinned during high rates of elongation and thickened when the growth cones were stationary. These findings suggest that forces cause lengthening because they stretch the axon and that growth occurs, in a loosely coupled step, by volume addition along the axon. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

These components are known to participate in the formation of many cellular structures, such as the dynamic asters found in mitotic and meiotic spindles3,4. Purified motors and microtubules have previously been observed to form asters in vitro5. We have reproduced this result with a simple system consisting solely of multi-headed constructs of the motor protein kinesin6 and stabilized microtubules. We show that dynamic asters can also be obtained from a homogeneous solution of tubulin and motors. By varying the relative concentrations of the components, we obtain a variety of self-organized structures. Further, by studying this process in a constrained geometry of micro-fabricated glass chambers7, we demonstrate that the same final structure can be reached through different assembly `pathways'.},

  abstract = {The axon is a sophisticated macromolecular machine composed of interrelated parts that transmit signals like spur gears transfer motion between parallel shafts. The growth cone is a fine sensor that integrates mechanical and chemical cues and transduces these signals through the generation of a traction force that pushes the tip and pulls the axon shaft forward. The axon shaft, in turn, senses this pulling force and transduces this signal in an orchestrated response, coordinating cytoskeleton remodeling and intercalated mass addition to sustain and support the advancing of the tip. Extensive research suggests that the direct application of active force is per se a powerful inducer of axon growth, potentially bypassing the contribution of the growth cone. This review provides a critical perspective on current knowledge of how the force is a messenger of axon growth and its mode of action for controlling navigation, including aspects that remain unclear. It also focuses on novel approaches and tools designed to mechanically manipulate axons, and discusses their implications in terms of potential novel therapies for re-wiring the nervous system.},

The stereotyped navigation of these axons defines the connectivity between brain regions and cellular subtypes. This chemotrophic guidance process mostly relies on the spatio-temporal expression patterns of extracellular proteins and the selective expression of their receptors in projection neurons. Axon guidance is stimulated by guidance proteins and implemented by neuronal traction forces at the growth cones, which engage local cytoskeleton regulators and cell adhesion proteins. Different layers of guidance signaling regulation, such as the cleavage and processing of receptors, the expression of co-receptors and a wide variety of intracellular cascades downstream of receptors activation, have been progressively unveiled. Also, in the last decades, the regulation of microtubule (MT) assembly, stability and interactions with the submembranous actin network in the growth cone have emerged as crucial effector mechanisms in axon pathfinding. In this review, we will delve into the intracellular signaling cascades downstream of guidance receptors that converge on the MT cytoskeleton of the growing axon. In particular, we will focus on the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) network responsible of MT dynamics in the axon and growth cone. Complementarily, we will discuss new evidences that connect defects in MT scaffold proteins, MAPs or MT-based motors and axon misrouting during brain development.},
